### What this is

Setup takes way too long, so I made this basic starting point I use for my single page MEAN stack applications.  Out of the box, you can get started with a NodeJS + ExpressJS backend wired up with a AngularJS/Less front end.  Comes with all the scaffolding and gulp tasks already set up.

### How to use

1. Load the dependencies! Get started with an `npm install` and a `bower install`

2. Build the front end files! Just run `gulp` to bundle/compile the front end JS, HTML, and CSS.

3. Spin up the application.  A simple `node server.js` does the deed.  [I do, however, prefer to run my server with nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)

4. develop develop develop.
