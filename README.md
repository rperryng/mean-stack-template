### What this is

Setup takes way too long.  This is the typical starting point I have for my single page MEAN stack applications.

### How to use

1. Load the dependencies! Get started with an `npm install` and a `bower install`

2. Build the front end files! Just run `gulp` to concatenate the JS, and the compile the LESS files.

3. Spin up the application.  A simple `node server.js` does the deed.  [I do, however, prefer to run my server with nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)

4. develop develop develop.
